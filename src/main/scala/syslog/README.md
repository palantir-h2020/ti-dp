# Syslog Preprocessing Pipeline

- The Syslog Preprocessing pipeline is a tool for processing and cleaning Kafka data using Scala.
- The first step is to transform the data into a DataFrame using the Kafka-Spark connector.
- A regular expression is applied to parse the data into individual fields, creating a new structured DataFrame.
- Stopwords are removed from the data using a `StopWordsRemover` function from the Spark ML library.
- The TF-IDF algorithm is applied to identify the importance of words in the document, implemented using the Spark ML library.
- The resulting TF-IDF vector is converted into a dense format for ease of analysis.
- Unnecessary fields are dropped from the DataFrame, leaving behind only the cleaned data.
- The cleaned DataFrame is sent back to Kafka for further analysis or processing.
- The pipeline utilizes advanced techniques to transform raw and unstructured data into a structured and meaningful format.
